# Project structure

The foundation layer: the vocabulary every other document uses, the disk layout those documents assume, and the manifest that ties a Project to a version of the methodology.

## The terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Project** | The root directory where work happens. Has a name (`project_name`). Contains a Payload and a Lore. |
| **Payload** | The Project's working materials. Lives at the project root by default, or in `<project>/payload/` in Publishing projects. See [Publish](#publish). |
| **Lore** | The support system. Lives at `<project>/.ai-lore-<project_name>/`. |
| **Memory** | The Project's record of its own thinking — status, focus, tracks, journal, blueprint, trees, save-points. Lives at `<lore>/memory/`. |
| **Track** | A persistent workspace within Memory — a branch + claim + posture + dials + focus pointer. Sessions mount tracks (one session per track). The **home** track always exists on trunk; child tracks branch from home and merge back. Lives at `<memory>/tracks/`. See [`tracks.md`](./tracks.md). |
| **References** | Pointers to other AI-Lore projects on disk this project consults for context. Read-only by contract. Live at `<lore>/references/`. Optional. |
| **Publish** | Curated destination derived from the Payload — the deliverable for projects whose ship target is not the Payload itself. Lives at `<project>/publish/`, paired with `<project>/payload/`. See [Publish](#publish). |

The Payload is the point — where the work happens. The Lore exists to serve it; Memory is the part of the Lore the session reads and writes as work proceeds; Tracks are the persistent workspaces within Memory that sessions mount to do that work; References, when present, point outward at other projects this one looks at; Publish, when present, is the curated subset that ships outward — the Payload remains the source of truth.

## Disk layout

### The project root

A Project's shape is visible at its root. The default is the Payload at the project root, no publish target. A Project that declares **Publishing** in `workspace.yaml` puts the Payload in `payload/` and the curated deliverable in `publish/`, both at the project root.

```
Default                               Publishing
─────────────────────────             ─────────────────────────
my-project/                           my-project/
├── ai_readme.md                      ├── ai_readme.md
├── [Payload files]   ← Payload       ├── payload/          ← Payload (workshop)
└── .ai-lore-my-project/   ← Lore     ├── publish/          ← Publish (deliverable)
                                      └── .ai-lore-my-project/   ← Lore
```

Code repositories, specs, documentation sets — anything whose deliverable is the Payload itself — fit the default and need no Publish target. Projects whose deliverable is a folder elsewhere (a Drive folder, a static-site source, a client directory) declare Publishing — the Payload moves into a `payload/` folder so the curated `publish/` sibling can sit cleanly beside it. The choice is set at [`init`](./verbs/init.md); see [Publish](#publish) for the details.

### The Lore

The Lore folder is identical in both shapes — same `.ai-lore-<project_name>/` layout, same contents (Publishing projects additionally author `blueprint/processes/publish.process.md`, but the folder shape is the same).

```
.ai-lore-my-project/                  ← Lore  (folder name = .ai-lore-${project_name})

│   └── knowledge-tree/                 reconciled / working / notepad, optional
│
└── references/                       ← References (optional)
    ├── references.index.md            registry
    └── <name>.md                      one file per referenced project
```

The methodology is placed into the project at [`init`](./verbs/init.md) time, version-pinned by `core_version`. Two pieces:

- **A two-line shim at `ai_readme.md` (project root)** — the AI-agnostic entry point. Says *"This project uses AI-Lore. Read `.ai-lore-<project_name>/process/ai_readme.md` and follow its instructions."* Any AI can be pointed at it.
- **The full methodology under `.ai-lore-<project>/process/`** — pillars and verbs, copied verbatim. The real entry point lives here as `process/ai_readme.md`; the root shim is just the path-less handshake the Human Lead types.

[`upgrade`](./verbs/upgrade.md) re-copies the methodology when the project moves to a new `core_version`. Engine bindings (see [`bindings.md`](./bindings.md)) layer engine-native delivery on top — they never replace this AI-agnostic baseline.

### The git arrangement

Memory (`<lore>/memory/`) and Payload (the Project root) are each their own git repository. They commit together as one unit through [`ack`](./verbs/ack.md), [`save-point`](./verbs/save-point.md), and the track-lifecycle verbs. Child tracks branch both repos together as `track/<name>`; home sits on `trunk` in both. The full git contract — `.gitignore` rules, the `<lore>/memory/.git/` location wart, vendored `process/` untracking, `publish/` in no repo, branch arrangement, drift signal mechanics — is covered in [`git.md`](./git.md).

## The Lore folder is uniquely named per project

The Lore folder is `.ai-lore-<project_name>/`, where `<project_name>` is the identifier from `workspace.yaml`. Every project has a different Lore folder name. AI sessions resolve paths by walking ancestors — two projects sharing a `.ai-lore/` name in the same ancestor chain would give ambiguous resolution. Unique names remove the ambiguity.

Project names must be filesystem-safe directory segments: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`.

## workspace.yaml

Lives at `<lore>/workspace.yaml`. A manifest, not a configuration file — behaviour is determined by Memory and the methodology, not by switches here.

By default a Project carries only the two required fields:

```yaml
project_name: my-project       # the Project's name; also the Lore folder suffix
core_version: "0.6"          # pinned AI-Lore version
```

A **Publishing** project adds a `publish:` block — presence of the block is the declaration:

```yaml
project_name: my-project
core_version: "0.6"

publish:                       # presence declares a Publishing project (see Publish)
  path: ./publish              # where Publish lives at the project root
  target: ~/Drive/my-project   # optional — symlink target; init creates the symlink if set
```

`project_name` names the Project and is the last segment of the Lore folder name; `core_version` records which version of AI-Lore the project runs against. Both are required; the `publish:` block is not.

## References

A project may consult other AI-Lore projects for context — a sibling project doing similar work, a parent project, a reference implementation. References make this explicit: the project declares which other projects it looks at and why.

References live at `<lore>/references/` — sibling to `memory/`, not inside it. Memory is the project's own thinking; references are pointers outward. The folder is **optional** — a project with no references simply has no `references/` folder.

Each reference is one file, `references/<name>.md`, with frontmatter and a body:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `type` | `reference` |
| `target_path` | the on-disk path to the referenced project's root (relative or absolute) |
| `purpose` | one line — why this project is referenced |
| `scope` | what part of the referenced project matters (all, a blueprint area, a KT branch, a Payload module) |

The body explains how to consult the reference — what to look at, when to look at it, any caveats. `references/references.index.md` lists what is registered.

References are **read-only by contract.** A session never writes through a reference into another project's Memory or Payload. Cross-project edits happen the other way around: open the other project explicitly and work there.

References are **link metadata only.** Insights this project draws from reading a referenced project belong in this project's knowledge tree, with `source` pointing back at the reference name. The reference file describes the link, not the project's interactions with it — otherwise it turns into a competing journal.

References are **not auto-loaded.** The session knows the folder exists from this document; it consults a reference when the work calls for cross-project context, not at every session open.

## Publish

A project whose deliverable is **not** the Payload itself — folders curated for delivery to Google Drive, a static site, a client folder, anywhere a path can point — declares a **Publish** target. The Publishing shape splits the project root into two sibling folders: `payload/` is the **workshop** where the work happens (drafts, sources, actuals); `publish/` is the **curated subset that ships**.

Publish is **optional.** A project with no `publish:` block in `workspace.yaml` is the default shape — the Payload lives at the project root directly, `init` and the methodology behave as before.

`payload/` and `publish/` sit at the project root, siblings to the Lore folder. The two folders carry different rules:

- **`payload/` is the Payload** — read–write per the active posture, tracked by the Payload repo, edited freely while in `execute`.
- **`publish/` is the deliverable** — written **only** by the [`publish`](./verbs/publish.md) verb. Writes outside the verb are refused regardless of posture. This keeps the curation gate honest.
- **`publish/` may be a real directory** (the publish process writes into it) **or a symlink to an external mount** (a Drive folder, a static-site source, a deploy directory). The choice is per-project — declared in `workspace.yaml` and shaped at [`init`](./verbs/init.md).
- **The recipe** — what crosses from `payload/` to `publish/`, how the sync runs, what curation rules fire — lives in `<lore>/memory/blueprint/processes/publish.process.md`. The verb is platform-neutral; the recipe is project-specific.

`publish/` is **derived state.** `payload/` is the source of truth; `publish/` is regenerable from `payload/` at any time via the [`publish`](./verbs/publish.md) verb. That asymmetry is the safety net: if `publish/` is corrupted, lost, or out of sync, re-publish.

The `workspace.yaml` `publish:` block declares the path and optional symlink target — see [workspace.yaml](#workspaceyaml) above for the format. Presence of the block is the declaration; absence means a default Project, and the [`publish`](./verbs/publish.md) verb refuses.
