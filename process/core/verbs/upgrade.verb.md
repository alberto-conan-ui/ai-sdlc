# upgrade

Move a project to a new core version: **replace `core/` wholesale, re-validate every
shadow, run the migration playbook, bump the pin.** Human-Lead-invoked — an upgrade
changes what the project runs on.

## When to invoke

- A new AI-Lore version ships and the project wants it.
- NOT for customizing the current version (that is shadowing, no upgrade involved).

## The merge decision, made small

The customization discipline is what keeps this verb routine: **core is never edited
in place — all customization is shadow-by-name, outside `core/`.** So the new core
replaces the old **wholesale** — no textual merge, ever. What remains is the honest
part the Human Lead owns:

**Shadow re-validation.** Every local (and parent-side) shadow was written against
the *old* core. Walk each against the new one, together: the core artifact it
shadows may have absorbed the fix (retire the shadow —
[`retire-verb`](./retire-verb.verb.md) restores the inherited artifact), changed
shape under it (amend the shadow), or vanished/renamed (the shadow stands alone now,
or follows the rename). Each shadow's one-line *what/why* — written when it was
authored — is what makes this walk minutes, not archaeology.

**The migration playbook** (`migration-from-v<old>.md`, shipped with the new core)
carries the version-specific reshapes — Memory-structure changes, renames, new
surfaces to scaffold. It is run **literally**, step by step; a playbook defect found
mid-run is a finding to file upstream, not something to improvise past silently.

Then: `core_version` bumped in the manifest (in the Memory repo — the bump leaves a
trace), the resolved set re-projected ([`install`](./install.verb.md)'s motion), and
the core-containment check re-run. The whole upgrade lands as one paired commit with
its accumulator row — the project can point at the moment it changed versions.

## The operation

1. **Verify the invoker**; **confirm the verb** (golden rule); home-mounted, no
   open children (an upgrade is a consolidation-grade act).
2. **Replace `core/`** wholesale from the new version's source.
3. **Walk the shadows** with the Human Lead; retire / amend / keep each, on the
   record.
4. **Run the migration playbook** literally; file defects found.
5. **Bump the pin; re-project; core-containment check.**
6. **One paired commit + accumulator row.** State the delta: version, shadows'
   fates, playbook findings.

## Refusals

- Not the Human Lead → refuse.
- Open child tracks → refuse; consolidate first.
- Core was edited in place (discipline violated upstream) → stop; that project has
  a real merge on its hands — surface it honestly before anything is replaced.
