# remove-parent

Drop a parent from the manifest — its artifacts leave the resolved set, its
contracts stop binding. **Human-Lead-invoked.** Inherits
[`add-parent`](./add-parent.verb.md)'s encyclopedia.

## When to invoke

- The upstream is dead, diverged, or the relationship ended.
- NOT to dodge one inherited artifact — shadow that one name instead
  ([`add-verb`](./add-verb.verb.md) / [`add-contract`](./add-contract.verb.md));
  removal is the whole relationship.

## What removal means

The delta runs in reverse and is walked with the Human Lead **before** landing:
verbs that disappear (and any local process step that references them by name — 
those processes are amended first or the removal refuses), shadows that stop
shadowing (the local artifact stays, now standing alone), contracts that stop
binding (said plainly — this is `retire-contract`-grade in effect, at wholesale).

## The operation

1. **Verify the invoker**; **confirm the verb** (golden rule); mounted.
2. **Compute and present the reverse delta**; amend dependent processes first.
3. **Remove the manifest line**; **re-project** the resolved set.
4. **State what changed** — gone, unshadowed, unbound.

## Refusals

- Not the Human Lead → refuse.
- A local process still references an inherited verb by name → amend first.
- The problem is one artifact → shadow it instead.
