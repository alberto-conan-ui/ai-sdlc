# add-stage

Attach a **stage** — a coherent batch of work toward a focus — under an existing
focus. The build inner loop's structural add: when a focus's work reveals its
batches, each batch becomes a stage.

## When to invoke

- The build starts and the focus's gate splits into ordered chunks.
- Mid-build, the work reveals a batch the original cut missed.
- NOT for a new unit of intent (that is [`add-new-focus`](./add-new-focus.verb.md))
  and NOT for a buildable step under a stage (that is
  [`add-phase`](./add-phase.verb.md)).

## What a stage is

L2 of the status tree — always a focus's direct child, never anywhere else. The four
shape rules hold: depth names the level, at most three deep, never skip or rename,
every level is a folder with a spec index. A stage that needs no breakdown stays a
bare stage; phases materialize under it only when buildable steps want naming.

A good stage is a **batch with a boundary**: it has an intent one sentence can carry,
a gate the Human Lead can check, and an end. Order stages by build sequence, not by
importance. Decompose late — grow a stage when the work is near, not to sketch a
roadmap; a speculative subtree is rot deferred.

The stage folder holds `<name>.index.md` (pure wiring) and `<name>.stage.md`:

| Frontmatter | Body sections |
|---|---|
| `type: stage`, `title`, `updated`, `gated`, `status`, `references` (Parent = the folder index) | Intent · Gate · Stack · Active child pointer · Journal trail |

Name kebab-case, sequence-prefixed where order matters (`s1-inventory`).

## The operation

1. **Confirm the verb** (golden rule): name `add-stage`, the parent focus, and the
   stage's intent; the Human Lead confirms. Ensure a mounted full track whose claim
   covers the focus.
2. **Verify the attach point** is a focus (L1). Under a stage → route to `add-phase`;
   under a phase → refuse, the tree ends at three.
3. **Create the structure**: stage folder + spec index + body scaffold (intent and
   gate drafted with the Human Lead; the rest minimal).
4. **Wire the parent**: the focus index's Children, and the focus body's Stack (in
   build order) and Active child pointer if this stage is now the active one.
5. **State what was created** and where it sits in the build order.

## Refusals

- Attach point is not a focus → route to the right level's verb.
- No mounted full track / outside claim → refuse.
- The "stage" is really a whole new intent → route to `add-new-focus`.
