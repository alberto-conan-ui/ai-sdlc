# install

`install` adds engine-native delivery on top of the AI-agnostic plain-text baseline. It runs once per project per engine. The methodology itself stays unchanged; install wires it into the engine's native mechanisms (skills, hooks, prefixes) so the engine triggers the handshake automatically instead of waiting for the Human Lead to type it.

The plain-text baseline is what [`init`](./init.md) puts in place: `ai_readme.md` at the project root and the methodology pillars under `.ai-lore-<project>/process/`. Any AI — Claude, Gemini, anything — can be pointed at the project, told *"read ai_readme.md"*, and operate. `install` does not replace that; it adds an automatic path on top.

## Invocation

`install` is invoked per engine, and the engine names the invocation: `install-claude`, `install-gemini`, and so on. The engine must have a binding section in [`bindings.md`](../bindings.md); installing an unsupported engine is refused.

## The operation

1. **Read the target engine's binding** — the section in [`bindings.md`](../bindings.md) that defines what "native form" means for this engine.
2. **Read the project's methodology** — the files [`init`](./init.md) placed at the project root and under `.ai-lore-<project>/process/`. This is the source for the engine projection.
3. **Write the engine-native form** per the engine's binding section.
   - For Claude (see [`bindings.md`](../bindings.md#binding-claude)): the `CLAUDE.md` handshake block (including the `/plan` collision steer); each verb as a skill at `.claude/skills/ai-lore-<verb>/SKILL.md` with synthesized frontmatter from `verbs.index.md`; `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` hook entries merged into `.claude/settings.json`.
   - For Gemini (see [`bindings.md`](../bindings.md#binding-gemini)): the `GEMINI.md` handshake block; each verb as a TOML slash command at `.gemini/commands/ai-lore-<verb>.toml` using `@file` injection from the canonical verb file; `SessionStart` and `SessionEnd` hook entries merged into `.gemini/settings.json`.
   - For other engines: follow the engine's binding section.
4. **Verify** — confirm the verbs are invocable in the engine and the bookends fire.

Re-running install is idempotent: the delimited block in `CLAUDE.md` is replaced, skill files are overwritten, only the named hook entries in `.claude/settings.json` are re-merged. Content outside those locations is preserved.

`install` never changes the methodology. It is a one-way projection: plain text in, engine-native form out. When the methodology changes (typically via [`upgrade`](./upgrade.md)), re-running `install` re-projects it.

`install` does not touch Memory; it needs the project to exist — the files placed by [`init`](./init.md) are its input.

## Prerequisites

Read [`bindings.md`](../bindings.md) (the target engine's binding section — the definition of its native form) before installing.
