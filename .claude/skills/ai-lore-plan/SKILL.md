# plan

`plan` sets the session's posture to Planning. While in Planning, the session discusses and writes plans; the Payload is read-only. The plan itself lands in Memory — in the active focus body or under an action tree — through [`write-lore`](./write-lore.md).

## The operation

1. **Write the posture to status** — set `posture: plan` in `status/status.index.md` via [`write-lore`](./write-lore.md).
2. **Produce the plan** — phases, decomposition, the shape the work needs. The plan is Memory: the focus body for a short plan, an action tree for a decomposed one.
3. **Refuse Payload writes** while Planning. A request to edit the Payload is held until the Human Lead invokes [`execute`](./execute.md).

The posture is the gate. Being in Planning is the standing permission to plan and the constraint that the Payload does not move yet.

## On engines with native plan modes

Some engines carry their own plan posture — Claude Code's `/plan` is one. The native posture may impose its own constraints, including an assigned plan-file path outside the project. **The plan itself still lands in Memory**, regardless of any harness-side plan-file assignment. If the engine routes a plan file outside the project, treat it as scratch — the Memory plan is authoritative.

For Claude Code specifically: invoke `/ai-lore-plan`, not Claude Code's native `/plan`, in an AI-Lore project. See [`bindings.md`](../../../.ai-lore-ai-sdlc/process/bindings.md#plan-mode-collision) for the full collision note.
