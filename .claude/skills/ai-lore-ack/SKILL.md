# ack

`ack` is how the Human Lead acknowledges accumulated work — the lightweight cousin of [`save-point`](./save-point.md). Same commit shape; no ledger entry, no blueprint check, no archive offer.

**The session never self-acks.** Acknowledgement is the Human Lead's confirmation that accumulated work has been reviewed; only they can give it.

## When the Human Lead invokes it

- After reviewing a batch of accumulated changes — Memory writes, Payload edits, or both.
- Before pausing, switching context, or closing the session, if the work is not yet milestone-level (which would be [`save-point`](./save-point.md)).
- Whenever the working tree is large enough that further work would compound the drift.

## What every ack is

A commit in each dirty repo with a Human-Lead-confirmed message capturing what is being acknowledged. Both repos commit together as one unit of acknowledgement; if only one repo is dirty, only that repo commits, but the unit is still "this ack."

A vague ack defeats the purpose — the message is what makes the acknowledgement reviewable later. The session helps draft a specific message grouped by area (focus, journal, blueprint, KT, AT, Payload); the Human Lead confirms or edits before the commit lands.

## Always offer close-session first

On every invocation, before proposing the commit message, ack asks the Human Lead one question: *"Run [`close-session`](./close-session.md) first?"* If yes, the bookend writes the journal, status, and any other closing artifacts, and those land in the same ack commit. If no, ack proceeds against the current dirty tree.

The offer is unconditional. ack does not infer whether this is "the closing ack" — the Human Lead decides. The cost is one extra HL turn-boundary per ack; the gain is that closing acks never leave trailing drift behind close-session.

## Relationship to save-point

`save-point` adds the ledger entry, the blueprint-contract check, and the archive offer on top of the ack's commit shape. A save-point on a dirty tree includes the implicit ack — the commit it produces *is* the acknowledgement of the working state.
